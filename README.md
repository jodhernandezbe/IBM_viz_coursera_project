This is a Python script written as part of the final project for the couse [Data Visualization with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-data-visualization) offered by IBM on Coursera.

You can use the requirements.txt file for creating an environment using either pip or anaconda, for instance:

```
conda create --name IBM_Viz --file requirements.txt
```
After that, you can use either the Jupyter Notebook or the IBM_course.py by executing:

```
python IBM_course.py
```

Running the above line you will obtain something like:

```bash
Dash is running on http://localhost:8050/

 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://localhost:8050/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

```

Copy and paste the link that looks like ```http://localhost:8050/``` into your browser for checking out the dashboard.
